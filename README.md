Project Overview

TutorConnect aims to provide an easy-to-use platform for students to connect with tutors and explore courses available for various subjects. The platform allows users to:
- Sign up and sign in.
- Explore and enroll in available courses.
- Rate services and provide feedback.
- View ratings in a dashboard and manage them with CRUD operations.

Features Implemented

1. Homepage (`pages/index.js`)
   - A professional-looking homepage with a dynamic course carousel slider powered by Swiper.js.
   - Courses are displayed in cards with "Read More" toggles for more information.

2. Navbar (`components/Navbar.jsx`)
   - Contains links to different sections of the website (Home, About, Contact, Sign In, Sign Up).
   - Incorporates the TutorConnect logo and uses a compact layout for better usability.

3. Sidebar (`components/Sidebar.jsx`)
   - A collapsible sidebar that appears on hover or click, providing quick navigation options.

4. About Page (`pages/about.js`)
   - Provides information about TutorConnect's mission and vision.
   - Allows users to create and view tutor profiles using a form with **React Hook Form** for validation and state management.

5. Contact Page (`pages/contact.js`)
   - Displays contact information for TutorConnect.
   - Includes a form for users to rate services using a star rating system.
   - Ratings are stored in local storage to persist between sessions, providing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing ratings.

6. Authentication Pages (`pages/signin.js` and `pages/signup.js`)
   - Sign In and Sign Up pages allow users to create and log in to their accounts.
   - Features include form validation, show/hide password functionality, and integration with potential authentication APIs.

7. Global Styles and Theming (`styles/globals.css`)
   - **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, with global styles configured for light/dark mode, typography, and custom classes.

8. Persistent State Management
   - Local storage is used to persist data such as user ratings, ensuring data remains consistent across page reloads.

Technologies and Dependencies

1. Frontend Framework
   - Next.js: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.

2. Styling
   - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving HTML.
   - Bootstrap: For additional styling needs, particularly for form and button elements.

3. UI Components and Libraries
   - React Hook Form: For managing form validation and state.
   - Swiper.js: For creating carousels and sliders.
   - React Icons: For adding icons across the application.

4. Local Storage
   - Browser-based storage to persist data (ratings).
